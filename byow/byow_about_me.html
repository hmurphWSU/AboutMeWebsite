                  <p>
                    My name is Hunter, and I was born on December 23, 2002 in Bitburg, Germany. Now, you may be 
                    wondering whether or not I speak German, and the answer is no, I don't actually speak German despite being born in Germany. 
                    My dad was in the airforce and was stationed in Germany at the time. We stayed in Germany for a little under 
                    2 years before moving to Roy, Utah and still living there to this day. Although I don't even remember because 
                    I was very young at the time, my parents got a divorce in the early 2000s despite my dad living with us for many years to
                    come. However, as of a couple years ago, my dad has moved back to Indiana where he lived originally to take 
                    care of his mom. I have 3 brothers and many cousins. Below I have pictures of a project I did in junior
                    high, and pictures of my family.
