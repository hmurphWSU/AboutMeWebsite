                    Over the years, my hobbies really have not changed at all. Throughout my life
                    I have enjoyed playing sports of all kinds and playing video games, and that continues
                    into present day. In case you were wondering, I don't really stick to a main type of video 
                    game, but the main ones recently have been Rocket League, Diablo 3, SMITE, and Lost Ark. 
                    If I had to pick favorites, I would say I most like playing soccer even though I'm not 
                    particularly good at it (I'm not really good at any sport, but that is beside the point),
                    and kickball. Although I did just say I like playing all sports, I must say, in junior high
                    we played a fair bit of spikeball which I did not particularly enjoy. Junior high was also
                    the only time I ever played hockey and I had a pretty good time. Below is a picture of the
                    only time that I played sports on an actual team.

                    As I am only 19, I don't really have much work experience. However, I would say I still
                    have less work experience than the average 19 year old. I have only worked at one place,
                    with that one place being Lagoon. I worked there for one season before I decided that I
                    didn't want to come back because I really was not a fan of how things were run in there.
                    In case you don't know the Lagoon application process, you apply for what area of the park
                    that you want to work in whether it be foods, rides, ticketing, etc. Once you choose which
                    area you want to work at, you have to choose two potential areas in the park to work. For example,
                    I chose to work in foods, and for my two areas I chose carousel, which is the food stands surrounding
                    the carousel toward the southern end of the park, and the Arby's toward the middle of the park. I never
                    worked at the Arby's, only in the carousel area. However, there are things called office shift where
                    instead of going to your normal area, they assign you anywhere that needs help, which resulted in me
                    working in a few different areas, most memorably the Swig at Laguna Beach.
