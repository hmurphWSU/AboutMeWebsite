                  <p> As you could probably expect, I really don't have anything left of the times that I was in
                      elementary school and junior high, but I will still cover where I went to school. As a side note, 
                      I know it's not really something that is common, but I did actually go to pre-school at a family
                      friend's pre-school. Continuing on, from kindergarten all the way to 5th grade I went to 
                      Municipal Elementary in Roy, Utah. In the middle of 5th grade, I transferred to Quest Academy 
                      where I carried out there from grades 5 to 9.

                  <h2> Junior High </h2>
                  <a href = "https://questac.org/" target = "_blank"> <img src = "byow/images/quest.jpg" alt = "Quest Academy"> </a>
                  <p> At Quest Academy, we did a lot of work online so I would have some work that I could show for my
                      junior high years, however, the accounts that we used that has all of the work we did was on their
                      school domain so I can no longer access it. However, as with most junior highs, you do have the option
                      to take some higher classes that could fulfill high school credits, which I took the opportunity to do.
                      While at Quest Academy, I took Financial Literacy, Health 1 and 2, and Geography for Life which satisfied
                      all of my health credits, my financial literacy credit, and part of my geography credit for the credits
                      that I needed with me going to NUAMES for high school.

                  <p>
                      As mentioned in the junior high section, I went to NUAMES for years in high school. NUAMES has been around
                      for almost 20 years, being started in Layton, Utah in 2004. However, in the fall of 2018, NUAMES expanded
                      their operations onto the Weber State University campus. This is when I started attending NUAMES. With the
                      Ogden campus only being open since 2018, my graduating class was the first class to attend the Ogden campus 
                      throughout all high school years (grades 10 to 12). Since NUAMES is an early college high school, you can
                      take college classes while being in high school, allowing you to graduate with a degree when you graduate
                      high school. I took this option and graduated from NUAMES with an associate's degree in science. I would have
                      something to show classes I have taken, however, as with my junior high, I can no longer access my account that
                      would tell me all of the classes I have taken.
